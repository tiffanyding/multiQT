## COVID data

The csv's in the `covid/` subdirectory are extracted from processing forecasts submitted to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub (see https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub/tree/master/data-processed)

## ARPA-E PERFORM data

Since this data is hosted publicly in an Amazon S3 bucket, we access the data directly from the source and do not provide an independent copy of the data in our Github repo. See https://github.com/PERFORM-Forecasts/documentation/tree/main
